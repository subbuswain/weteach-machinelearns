## Day 1: 03.08.2025 Sunday 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM
We did our first session in our "We Teach-Machine Learns" journey today. Today's session was about refresher of Python fundamentals by creating a Phonebook application with basic functionality like add contact, search contact and display contact list. We further extended that mini application to a fun lottery system where 3 persons from the contact list are awarded with prizes.

## Day 2: 09.08.2025 Saturday 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM

It was the 2nd session in our "WeTeach-MachineLearns" journey, and we learned about csv file parsing using the csv module of Python. As csv files are the most commonly used dataset format, it was good to have an outlook on it before we go to Pandas. We used different ways to work on csv files and did some basic manipulations using dictionary.

Key insights:
1.⁠ ⁠csv module
2.⁠ ⁠Reading a csv file
3.⁠ ⁠Writing into a csv file
4.⁠ ⁠Copying csv file
5.⁠ ⁠Deleting fields using dictionary comprehension
