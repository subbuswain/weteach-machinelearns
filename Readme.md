## Day 1: 03.08.2025 Sunday 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM
We did our first session in our "We Teach-Machine Learns" journey today. Today's session was about refresher of Python fundamentals by creating a Phonebook application with basic functionality like add contact, search contact and display contact list. We further extended that mini application to a fun lottery system where 3 persons from the contact list are awarded with prizes.
